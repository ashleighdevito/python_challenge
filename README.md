# python_challenge
This project contains a python script to analyze two sets of data.  One financial analysis and the other a political election. 

The financial analysis reads data contained within a csv file and reports:

	The total number of months included in the datase 
	The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
		Finds the average of those changes
	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
      
The election report provides:

	The total number of votes cast
	A complete list of candidates who received votes
	The percentage of votes each candidate won
	The total number of votes each candidate won
	The winner of the election based on popular vote
      
Both analyses print to terminal and export a text file.
